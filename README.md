## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains information on advertising expenditures and sales performance. Key features include:
- TV advertising budget
- Radio advertising budget
- Newspaper advertising budget
- Sales (Target variable)

The goal is to predict **sales** based on one or more of the advertising channels.
